# Beaver Builder Flodesk

Beaver Builder Flodesk is a simple no settings plugin that allows you to use Flodesk as a service provider when using the [Subscribe Form](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder/layouts/modules/subscribe-form/) module. It's based on the built in ConvertKit class.

To use:

- Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/zackeryfretty/Beaver-Builder-Flodesk/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Install & activate the plugin usual way.
- Select "Flodesk" when using the Subscribe Form module and enjoy!

NOTE: Please use this plugin at your own risk, I can't be held responsible if it does anything crazy on you or breaks. The Flodesk API seems pretty new, so things may change.
